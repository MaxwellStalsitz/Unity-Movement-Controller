# Unity-Movement-Controller
Simple character controller based movement controller, with support for jumping, animation, and all around movement (along with slope detection)

Implementation is as simple as moving the script to an object (preferably a capsule/player) that contains a character controller component.
From there, you can tweak and change the preset settings as much as you would like. Thanks.
