# Unity-Movement-Controller
Simple character controller based movement controller, with support for jumping, animation, mouse-based viewing, and general mobility.

Implementation is as simple as moving the script to an object (preferably a capsule/player)
From there, you can tweak and change the preset settings as much as you would like, example of Setup can be found in the Example Scene. Thanks.
